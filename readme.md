👋 Hi, @dreamscached here! Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile.

🚶‍♂️ I'm 18 y.o. computer science student currently living and studying in Czechia 🇨🇿

👨‍💻 I primarily develop and contribute to Go/Python/JVM projects, occasionally
using JS/TS and Svelte for web development when I have ideas. Sometimes I
help people with maintaining repositories with such things as Ren'Py games/mods.
I'm also into various crypto- and P2P-based stuff, such as Bitcoin, IPFS and ZeroNet.

🎁 I'm [accepting commissions](https://ko-fi.com/dreamscached/commissions) for Monika After Story content and Minecraft plugins.

💻 I use Arch Linux with KDE desktop as my primary OS both for work and for
everyday needs. My laptop is HP ProBook 430 G7.
