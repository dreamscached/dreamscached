👋 Hi, I'm [@dreamscached](https://github.com/dreamscached)! Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile.

👨‍💻 I'm 21 y.o. computer science student currently living and studying in Czechia 🇨🇿

👨‍💻 I primarily develop and contribute to Go/Python/JVM projects, occasionally using JS/TS and Svelte for 
web development when I have ideas. I am interested in Linux system administration and software development, 
both of which I am very eager to learn more about and gain more experience at, and I'm always looking for 
opportunities to grow and hone my skills.

💻 I use Arch Linux with KDE desktop as my primary OS both for work and for everyday needs. My laptop is HP ProBook 430 G7.
