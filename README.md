👋 Hi, @dreamscached here! Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile.

🚶‍♂️ I'm 18 y.o. computer science student currently living in Czechia 🇨🇿 and 
applying for IT majors at local universities.

👨‍💻 I primarily develop and contribute to Go/Python/JVM projects, occasionally
using JS/TS and Svelte for web development when I have ideas. Sometimes I
help people with maintaining repositories with such things as Ren'Py games/mods.

💻 I use Arch Linux with KDE desktop as my primary OS both for work and for
everyday needs. My laptop is HP ProBook 430 G7.
